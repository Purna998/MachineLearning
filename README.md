🚀 Machine Learning End-to-End Project

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline using Amazon SageMaker. The project covers everything from data preprocessing and training to deployment and inference.

Although this example uses a Random Forest Classifier for a classification task, the structure can be applied to most ML problems (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

📂 Project Structure

Dataset

Features: Structured data with multiple attributes (numerical & categorical).

Target: Label to be predicted (e.g., classification categories or regression values).

Size: Example dataset ~2000 samples × 21 features.

Pipeline Steps

Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Model Training (Scikit-learn in SageMaker)

Evaluation

Deployment (Real-time endpoint)

Inference & Monitoring

🛠️ Prerequisites
1. AWS Setup

AWS Account with SageMaker and S3 access

IAM Role with SageMaker execution permissions

S3 bucket to store data & model artifacts

2. Python Environment

Required packages:

pip install sagemaker boto3 pandas scikit-learn numpy

3. AWS Configuration

Update placeholders in the notebook:

IAM Role → arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<your-sagemaker-role>

S3 Bucket → your-s3-bucket-name

📖 Step-by-Step Workflow
🔹 Step 1: Environment Setup

Import libraries

Initialize SageMaker session

🔹 Step 2: Data Loading & Exploration

Load dataset (CSV/Parquet/JSON)

Explore data (shape, null values, distributions)

Analyze target variable

🔹 Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Split features & target

Train-test split (e.g., 80/20)

Save datasets as CSV for SageMaker

🔹 Step 4: Upload Data to S3

Upload training & testing sets

🔹 Step 5: Training Script (script.py)

Includes:

Load data from S3

Preprocess features

Train ML model (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Evaluate accuracy / metrics

Save trained model

🔹 Step 6: Configure Estimator

Define SageMaker estimator with:

Training image (scikit-learn)

Instance type (e.g., ml.m5.large)

Hyperparameters

🔹 Step 7: Train Model

Launch training job on SageMaker

🔹 Step 8: Deploy Model

Deploy trained model to an endpoint

Instance type: ml.m4.xlarge (for inference)

🔹 Step 9: Make Predictions

Send sample payloads to endpoint

Receive predictions

🔹 Step 10: Cleanup

Delete SageMaker endpoints to avoid unnecessary costs

📊 Model Performance

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix

Validation: Separate test set evaluation

⚡ Cost Optimization

Use Spot Instances (up to 70% cheaper)

Shutdown endpoints after testing

Monitor AWS billing dashboard

🔐 Security Best Practices

Use IAM roles with minimal permissions

Enable S3 encryption

Delete endpoints when not in use

Regularly monitor AWS costs

🔧 Troubleshooting
Common Issues

Permission Errors → Ensure IAM role + S3 permissions

Training Failures → Check script.py + dataset paths

Version Issues → Use SageMaker-supported framework versions

Debugging

Review CloudWatch logs

Check SageMaker job error messages

📦 Expected Outputs

Training Logs (from SageMaker)

Model Artifacts → s3://your-bucket/model.tar.gz

Deployed Endpoint → For inference

💡 Next Steps

Try different algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, Deep Learning)

Implement Hyperparameter Tuning

Add Model Monitoring & Drift Detection

Automate with CI/CD for ML (MLOps)
